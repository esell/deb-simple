Description: Vi IMproved - enhanced vi editor - compact version
 Vim is an almost compatible version of the UNIX editor Vi.
 .
 Many new features have been added: multi level undo, syntax
 highlighting, command line history, on-line help, filename
 completion, block operations, folding, Unicode support, etc.
 .
 This package contains a minimal version of vim compiled with no
 GUI and a small subset of features in order to keep small the
 package size. This package does not depend on the vim-runtime
 package, but installing it you will get its additional benefits
 (online documentation, plugins, ...).
